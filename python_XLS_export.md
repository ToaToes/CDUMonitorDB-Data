```
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

If openpyxl is correctly installed and you're still encountering the issue, please check the versions of pandas and openpyxl using the following commands:
```
pip show pandas
pip show openpyxl
```

Make sure they are compatible with each other. You can also try upgrading both:

```
pip install --upgrade pandas openpyxl
```
